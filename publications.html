          <p>
            Among the myriad of factors affecting vulnerability to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, relatively little attention
            has been paid to the communication of risk and uncertainty. Having a better understanding of the risks associated with a hurricane
            will improve the chances of saving lives and mitigating property and economic losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to design an information provision system that communicates the minimal critical pieces of information to the maximum number
            of people from diverse backgrounds.

              This article provide a review framework for understanding hurricane risk communications and
              emphasizes the need for more personalized hurricane risk information systems that take into account cultural,
              geographical, linguistic, and economic circumstances. This short article appears in BAMS’ Paper of Note section.

              This paper is a cross-disciplinary and critical review of hurricane risk communication development, focused on  1) research concerning visual communications and
              the way in which individuals process, understand, and make decisions regarding them and 2) the way in which vulnerable communities understand and interact with
              hurricane warning communications.

                Analyzing Dorian Twitter data to understand how hurricane risk communication changes as threats unfold

            <p>
              This research explores diffusion of forecast messages on social media for Hurricane Dorian (2019) to understand how hurricane risk information is created, disseminated, and discussed in many-to-many
              communication modes. We collected streams of posts from professional Twitter accounts, conducted a descriptive statistical analysis of manually-coded tweets to identify hurricane risk message types,
              performed a network analysis to audit engagement among different types of accounts, and calculated sentiment scores to examine message opinions.

                Beautiful Visualizations Slain by Ugly Facts: Redesigning the National Hurricane Center’s ‘Cone of Uncertainty’ Map

            </h2>
            <p>
              The Track Forecast Cone, commonly known as the “cone of uncertainty”, is the most popular hurricane and tropical storm forecast product that the
              National Hurricane Center produces. However, it is often misinterpreted by non-experts. In this study we first explored the most common misconceptions
              about the cone and produced two alternative redesigns that we expected to be more attractive to and easier to understand by non-expert readers. Our results were mixed,
              but reveal promising paths for future efforts.

              This systematic review investigates design attributes that influence the expression of uncertainty visualization in weather forecasts, revealing six categories of design
              features that can inform how viewers interpret the uncertainty conveyed in weather forecast displays. These design features also provide us with an initial basis for developing guidelines.
